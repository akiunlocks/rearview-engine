===============================================================================

Before running rearview you must specify a few settings manually.

Edit the following file:

    config/initializers/rearview.rb

You must set **config.graphite_connection** and **config.sandbox_exec** 
for rearview to run properly. Most of the other settings you should be able to 
leave as is.
